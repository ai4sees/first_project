Multiple camera calibration with varying degrees of FOV involves determining the geometric parameters of cameras with different fields of view to align their perspectives in a shared coordinate system. Scenarios include partial overlap, full overlap, and non-overlapping fields of view. Key modules to implement include intrinsic and extrinsic parameter calculation, selection and detection of appropriate calibration patterns, synchronized image acquisition, initial pair-wise calibration, and simultaneous multi-camera optimization. Validation involves assessing calibration accuracy through reprojection, translation, and rotation error metrics, using advanced techniques like NeRF-based validation for enhanced accuracy.
